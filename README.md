}
```

## Trading Strategies

The **Trading Bot** supports various trading strategies. Here are a few examples:

### 1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)

This strategy uses the average price over a specific period to determine buy and sell signals. 

### 2. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

EMA gives more weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.

### 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI helps identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market.

### 4. Bollinger Bands

This strategy uses volatility to create bands around the price, indicating potential entry and exit points.

You can easily implement your own strategies by modifying the strategy files in the `strategies` directory.

## API Integration

The bot can connect to various cryptocurrency exchanges via their APIs. Currently, it supports:
